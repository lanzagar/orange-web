<h1>Introduction to Data Mining</h1>
<p class="bottom-margin">Data science is an interdisciplinary field that deals with scientific methods, processes,
    and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data. The course will introduce machine learning and
    data visualization techniques to uncover hidden patterns in data. </p>

<h2>Why should I attend?</h2>
<ul class="bottom-margin">
    <li>You will learn essential approaches in data science that include data exploration, visualization,
        unsupervised machine learning, classification and regression.
    </li>
    <li>After completing the course, you will be able to analyze your own data and use them to develop predictive
        models.
    </li>
    <li>The course will be hands-on and will introduce data science concepts and methods through the analysis of
        real-life data from biomedicine.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What will I learn?</h2>
<ul class="bottom-margin">
    <li>Explorative data analysis</li>
    <li>Data visualization</li>
    <li>Predictive models (classification and regression)</li>
    <li>Clustering and segmentation</li>
    <li>Data projection</li>
</ul>

                <p>"Introduction to Data Mining is an excellent course that uses Orange to teach students of all levels the fundamentals of data mining and machine learning. Through the fantastic visualization tools for viewing data and models, Orange made complex mathematical ideas much more intuitive and accessible. This course has allowed me to approach my research (neuroimaging analysis of psychiatric patients) in an entirely novel way! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone working with large data sets."

                <p>"Lately, I am fascinated by how easy it is to explain machine learning to anybody. In just a few hours. To the point where a course attendee would go home and use machine learning on her own data. Or on any data from the web. And she would understand how artificial intelligence helps Google, Amazon, and Netflix. For such training, you need the right tools. And it is here where Orange shines. " </p>
